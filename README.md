# About CO2 Widgets
Since 2008, website admins have been using simple HTML widget code available from my website, http://co2now.org to display the latest reading for atmospheric CO2 on their website.   Web admins and owners can choose from several website designs at co2now.org/Current-CO2/CO2-Widget/.  An excess concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere makes a significant contribution to global warming an climate change.   HTML code for the widgets requires periodic updates.  In Fall 2015, the primary source for obtaining widget code will change from CO2Now.org to Show.Earth.
